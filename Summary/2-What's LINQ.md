# Introduction to LINQ

**LINQ** stands for **Language Integrated Query**.

The word **"Query"** refers to a method or expression used to retrieve data from a specific source — this is a standard concept across various data technologies. This definition is officially mentioned in Microsoft's documentation.

## Why LINQ?

In real-world applications, developers often deal with multiple types of data sources:

- Relational databases (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL)
- XML files
- NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB)
- JSON files
- In-memory collections (e.g., arrays, lists)

Traditionally, working with each of these data sources required learning a different query language:
- SQL for databases  
- XQuery for XML  
- Specific APIs for JSON or NoSQL

## LINQ as a Unifier

LINQ provides **one unified query syntax** to access data, no matter what the source is.

Rather than learning multiple query languages, you can use **C# objects** (collections, lists, datasets, etc.) and write queries using standard LINQ expressions.

This simplifies your development workflow and reduces the cognitive load on the developer.

##  Key Concept

> LINQ allows you to write **queries using standard C# syntax** to retrieve and manipulate data from any source in a consistent and readable way.

## Why Every C#/.NET Developer Must Know LINQ?

- It's used almost everywhere in modern .NET applications.
- Simplifies data processing
- Frequently asked about in interviews
- Works seamlessly with collections, databases, XML, JSON, and more

> **Bottom line:** If you're working with C# or .NET — you **must** learn LINQ. It's not optional; it's essential.
